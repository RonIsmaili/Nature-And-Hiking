# Nature And Hiking

During my second semester, at the South East European University, I took the course Internet Technologies where we had to work with HTML, CSS & Javascript to create a website for our final project. <br>
I created a fully responsive and modern looking website using the above mentioned technologies. The theme of the website revolves around nature and hiking.

There is not much to say about this project except that it was the first time I tried to create a responsive website.
